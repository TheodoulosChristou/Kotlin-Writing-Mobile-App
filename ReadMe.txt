/***
There are many steps to run the MusicApp in the Emulator
***/

/***
First,install an emulator and run the program.
***/

/***
Second, you will run the program then you will see the first screen 
of my application which has three buttons: Play which you can play the game,
shop which you can buy information for artist but you must have the requirement points and 
finally the settings icon which you can set the mode of the game.If you press the settings icon you can see
that the mode is in current by default and you can change it to current or leave it as it is.
Moreover,press the save button and the game mode will be saved and you will be back to the first screen.

/***
When you press the play button you can see the game description in the second screen and when
you press next then it will show you a third screen which is the Google Maps.
***/

/***
In google Maps as you can see your location is based on bay campus as the specification
of the game is and you can see around you 20 music notes which you can press to each of them 
for guess the song.
***/

/***
By press the music note the app will show you the fourth screen which you can see the
lyric of the song and by clicking next you will see the fifth screen which as you can see
you can guess the title and the artist of the song and also to see your current score and how many attempts
do you have.
***/

/***
You have three attempts each time that you guess a lyric.To find the answers you have to 
write them with lower cases and if you think that in one song there are more aritsts submit 
your answer with ("artist" ft "artist").If you guess correclty the artist and the song then the app will show you
a sixth screen which you can see all the available points of mode that you choose to play,the correct answers,
your gained points,lost points and your current points which are your previous score plus title points plus artist points else if you find one of each 
then the app will show you again the sixth screen which you can see all the available points of mode that you choose to play,the correct
answers of title and artist your gained points,lost points and  your current points which are your previous score plus the component that you found minus the component
that you don't found.Finally if you don't guess correctly the answers then then the app will show you again the sixth screen which you can see all the 
available points of mode that you choose to play ,your gained points,
lost points and  your current points which are your previous score minus all the component that you don't found. Remerkable fact is that if your score is less than zero 
then it automatically set it as zero.If you think that you will not guess the song then you can give up by click the give up button in the 5th screen and the app
will show to you a 7th screen which you can see the correct answers of the title and artist,gained points,lost points, your score which is your previous score minus all
the components.After all these things that I mentioned if you are in the sixth screen you can press the next song button and you will go back to the Google Maps Screen and 
if you are in 7th screen you can press the next song button to go back to google Maps screen to find other songs.

the back button in the navigation of the emulator.If you pressed it then you can see the settings button and change the game Mode.After that you will be back to the 
first screen to play the game with the mode that you choose.
